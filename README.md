# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Truls
An 18-year-old ambitious developer and entrepreneur from Sweden who loves building things and seeing them grow. I'm currently working on [KÃ¶Koll](https://kokoll.nu/), a website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Apart from coding I like to exercise (love training Muay Thai), read, and hang out with friends.

## Projects
- [**KÃ¶Koll**](https://kokoll.nu/): A website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Works by using requests or Selenium to programmatically sign up or log in to 200 different housing queues for the user.

- [**Axum Boilerplate**](https://github.com/truls27a/axum-boilerplate): A boilerplate for the Rust-based API framework Axum. Includes secure authentication using JWTs and cookies. Intended to allow developers (me included) to skip writing boring and repetitive authentication and configuration code when starting new APIs. Fun side project to get better at Rust.

- [**Code G**](https://github.com/truls27a/code-g): A terminal-based AI chat application that can read and write to files. Intended to help developers code and build projects by allowing them to leverage AI right in their terminal. Fun side project to get better at Rust.

 - [**Bottify UF**](https://bottify.se/): NOTE: No longer an active member since spring 2025. A website that intends to make AI accessible for everyone, especially older people and people unfamiliar with technology. Achieves this by NOT using a chat based interface like other AI tools and instead using a more action focused web interface with great UX.
