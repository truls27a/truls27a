# 👋 Hi, I'm Truls
An 19-year-old ambitious developer and entrepreneur from Sweden who loves building things and seeing them grow. I'm currently working on [KöKoll](https://kokoll.nu/), a website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Apart from coding I like to exercise (love training Muay Thai), read, and hang out with friends.
