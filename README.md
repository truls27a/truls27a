# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Truls
An 18-year-old ambitious developer and entrepreneur from Sweden who loves building things and seeing them grow. I'm currently working on [KÃ¶Koll](https://kokoll.nu/), a website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Apart from coding I like to exercise (love training Muay Thai), read, and hang out with friends.

## Projects
- [**KÃ¶Koll**](https://kokoll.nu/): A website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Works by using requests or Selenium to programmatically sign up or log in to 200 different housing queues for the user.

- [**CodeG**](https://github.com/truls27a/code-g): Your G when it comes to coding. CodeG is a terminal-based AI chat application that helps you code. Like Cursor, but in your terminal.

- [**pnrgen**](https://github.com/truls27a/pnrgen): A CLI for generating Swedish test personnummer from Skatteverket's official test database.
