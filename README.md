# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Truls
An 18-year-old ambitious developer and entrepreneur from Sweden who loves building things and seeing them grow. I'm currently working on [KÃ¶Koll](https://kokoll.nu/), a website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Apart from coding I like to exercise (love training Muay Thai), read, and hang out with friends.

## Projects
- [**KÃ¶Koll**](https://kokoll.nu/): A website that automatically manages users' housing queues. Works by using requests or Selenium to programmatically sign up or log in to 200 different housing queues for the user.

- [**CodeG**](https://github.com/truls27a/code-g): Your G when it comes to coding. CodeG is a terminal-based AI chat application that helps you code. Like Cursor, but in your terminal.

- [**MiniRedis**](https://github.com/truls27a/miniredis): MiniRedis is a mini version of Redis, a key value store. It features two binaries, a server and a client. The server binary starts up a server that accepts GET, SET, and DEL operations. The client binary starts up a client that reads operation commands from the user through the terminal, sends it to the server, and prints out the result.

- [**MiniGrep**](https://github.com/truls27a/minigrep): A small command-line tool written in Rust to search for lines matching a pattern in a file.

- [**Axum Boilerplate**](https://github.com/truls27a/axum-boilerplate): A boilerplate for the Rust-based API framework Axum. Includes secure authentication using JWTs and cookies. Intended to allow developers (me included) to skip writing boring and repetitive authentication and configuration code when starting new APIs.

- [**Bottify UF**](https://bottify.se/): A website that with the purpose of make AI accessible for everyone, especially older people and people unfamiliar with technology. Achieves this by NOT using a chat based interface like other AI tools and instead using a more action focused web interface with great UX.
